#compare two numbers and finding out the greater one:

a = 5 
b = 6 
if a>b: #condition ( where we evaluate if a is greater then b or not)
    
    
    print('the greater value is a:',a)


else: #condition ( if b > a this condition work )
    
    print ("the greater value is b:", b)    
    







#likewise we can take values form user and compare two numbers:

x = int (input("enter first value:")) #taking first value from user
y = int ( input("enter second value:")) # taking second value from user

if x>y: #condition ( where we evaluate if x is greater then y or not)
    
    
    print('the greater value is a:',x)


else: #condition ( if y > x this condition work )
    
    print ("the greater value is b:", y)
