...............HERE WE WILL DISCUSS ABOUT THE PYTHON identifiers...............


an identifiers is a name given to entities like:

class 
functions
variables... etc


    THERE ARE SOME RULES FOR WRITING identifiers:

    RULE NUMBER 1:

    Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) 
    or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _. 
    Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.

   
   
    RULE NUMBER 2:

    An identifier cannot start with a digit. 
    1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.


    RULE NUMBER 3:


    keywords cannot be used as identifier

    for example;

    if = 1 (((((((nooooo nnoooooooo ))))))) //dont write like this hehehhehe



    RULE NUMBER 4:


    We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier. 

    for example:

    a% = 1  ((((((((no no nnoooooooo)))))))) //dont do this..



    RULE NUMBER 5:


    An identifier can be of any length.









note::::::


Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and variable are not the same.

Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense. While c = 10 is a valid name, 

writing count = 10 would make more sense, and it would be easier to figure out what 

it represents when you look at your code after a long gap.

Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, like this_is_a_long_variable.
