   .........here we learn about keywords........


python have some set of already define keywords which cannot used as variables , functions or any set of identifiers. 

so keywords are unique defined terms or may say reserved word in python..

keywords  are case sensitive so you have to write them as they are

ðŸ”  some of the keywords which begins with capital letters in python are : 
 True 
 Flase 
 None 

beside these all are lowercase of small letters.


keywords in python are listed below:

False	await	  else	    import   	pass
None	break	  except	in      	raise
True	class	  finally	is	        return
and	   continue	  for	    lambda	    try
as	    def	      from	    nonlocal	while
assert	del	      global	not	        with
async	elif	  if	    or	        yield
